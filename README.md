#### Challenges
- There is some compatibility issue with NVM and NPM. As soon as I open the zsh terminal, I get the following warning.
		
		nvm is not compatible with the npm config "prefix" option: currently set to "/Users/nmohammed/.nvm/v0.10.40"  
		Run `npm config delete prefix` or `nvm use --delete-prefix v0.10.40 --silent` to unset it.
		
		$ nvm use --delete-prefix v0.10.40
		Now using node v0.10.40 (npm v1.4.28)
